MAZE PROBLEM
	From a starting position provided by user in a 2x2 array of 0s and 1s, get to E location by moving to only spots with a '0'.
	At the end, show either that there is no path, or mark the path taken with '+'

INPUT
- txt file of maze
- user input (row, column) for starting point
	

OUTPUT
- print the maze at start, with an S
- print the maze at end, and either 'I am trapped', or 'I am free' along with the path taken in '+'


DATA STRUCTURES
- 2x2 matrix 'maze'
- tuple 'start'
- tuple 'position'
- stack 'options'
- array 'visited' (initialize all to 0)


PSEUDO *INCPMPLETE*
1. read in maze and start position
2. look at 4 adjacent positions:
	a. if 0 or E, push that position onto stack
3. while stack not empty:
	[if stack empty: print maze and 'I am trapped'
	a. pop position from stack
	b. mark that position with a +
	c.
